# javascript-learning-mini-projects
started learning javascript and building small projects.

made 3 mini projects using js and html without any styling (coz im just working on logic of JS)

ill continue to make mini projects (at least ten) till im okay to move to major projects , 
anyone who is learning js should atleast make these mini projects to build up strong foundation of js and its logic , 
and can look at this as reference.

further ill add all the live working links of this mini projects.

Thanks :)
